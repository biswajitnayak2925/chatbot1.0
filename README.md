# chatbot1.0
Transformer-based chatbot trained on dialogue data using PyTorch, including data preprocessing, model training, and inference scripts.
This repository contains the implementation of a transformer-based chatbot built using PyTorch.  
The project covers data preprocessing, tokenization, model training, evaluation, and inference.

Project Overview

- Task: Conversational response generation
- Model: Transformer (Encoder–Decoder)
- Framework: PyTorch
- Dataset: Dialogue dataset (e.g., DailyDialog )
- Training Environment: Google Colab

- The model generates context-aware responses based on trained dialogue data.
Performance can be further improved by increasing dataset size, training epochs, or model depth.
